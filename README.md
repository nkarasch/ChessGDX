:stop_sign: DEPRECATED as of the LibGDX change to lwjgl3

Updated to LibGDX 1.11.0 and Gradle 7.3.3 via user difficulty comment.

# ChessGDX
ChessGDX is a 3D chess game built on LibGDX that takes advantage of UCI-Protocol compliant chess engines. It is a functional, but narrowly scoped project I made while learning LibGDX.
